Step 3: It will ask if you want to download the required files answer Y for Yes or N for No (Chromedriver for latest version of chrome, if you have chromedriver.exe on your desktop choose No if you don't then choose Yes, let it download and extract the file)

Step 4: Choose the server you are on with a number (ROTS1 = 1, ROTS = 2, ROTS3 = 3, M4U = 4)

Step 5: Choose the customer ID(Number shown in console) whom you want to kill all sap proccess for
